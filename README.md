# Dashboard
This dashboard is about a dataset of all Netflix original films released as of June 1st, 2021. The dataset consists of data that was web-scraped off a Wikipedia page. I acquired the dataset from Kaggle and used it to develop a plot of film titles based on their genre, language, runtime and IMDB Scores. It can help the user view movies based on their desired ratings and runtime. The user needs to select a genre of film that interests them and one or more languages that the films in the genre are available in, the selection of films that meet these selections will be plotted and displayed on the data table. The data table gives the movie title, genre, premiere date, runtime, IMDB Score and language of the selected movies.
